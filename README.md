CrimeStat records the details of office crimes, for improving office discipline. 

With CrimeStat, you can make a record of a crime including a title, a date, and a photo. You can also send a report through any messaging app. After documenting and reporting a crime, you can proceed with your work free of resentment and ready to focus on the business at hand.

The crime reports(excluding the photo) are stored in a sqlite database and the photos are stored in the app's private files.
